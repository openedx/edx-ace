Implement Push Notification Channel
===================================

Status
--------

Proposed

Context
--------

The goal of ACE framework is to provide extensible mechanism for extending delivery channels and policies.
However, as of May 2024, edx-ace supports various email delivery channels like
django and Sailthru as well as third party API integration for Braze, but lacks
support for direct mobile push notifications.
Adding push notifications delivery channel will enable real-time communication
with users through their mobile devices, enhancing user engagement and
ensuring timely delivery of important information.
Flexibility and seamless integration with the existing framework are priorities for this new notification channel.

`ace.send` already supports sending via multiple channels.
It turns out that in order to send both push and email notifications,
you need to add a new channel `push_notifications` to the `ACE_ENABLED_CHANNELS`.

Decision
--------

Implement a new push notification system.
Data for push notifications must be formatted according to mobile push notification requirements.
It should be possible to add optional payloads for advanced functionality (e.g. data for notification actions).
Send formatted push notifications using the firebase_admin_ SDK.
Integration with django-push-notifications_ to simplify the process of sending notifications.
Use the existing `GCMDevice` model and `GCMDeviceViewSet` view from
django-push-notifications_ to manage user device tokens.
Provide secure and authenticated communication with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

It is proposed to add a new optional argument `limit_to_channels=None` to the
`ace.send` method, which can specify the list of channels through which
messages should be sent. This will allow more flexibility,
for example in cases with discussion notifications, where we need to send
a push for each new reply, while an email is sent only for the first reply.

In this case, the code will look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    message_context = _build_message_context(context, notification_type='forum_response')
    message = ResponseNotification().personalize(
        Recipient(thread_author.id, thread_author.email),
        _get_course_language(context['course_id']),
        message_context
    )
    log.info('Sending forum comment notification with context %s', message_context)
    if _is_first_comment(context['comment_id'], context['thread_id']):
        limit_to_channels = None
    else:
        limit_to_channels = [ChannelType.PUSH]
    ace.send(message, limit_to_channels=limit_to_channels)


For the first response (as it is currently implemented), both notifications
will be sent, and for all other replies, only push notifications will be sent.

The `_build_message_context` method should also be extended:

.. code-block:: python

    push_notification_extra_context': {
        'notification_type': 'notification_type',
        'thread_id': context['thread_id'],
        'comment_id': context['comment_id'],
    }


The presence of `push_notification_extra_context` will be checked in the
`CoursePushNotificationOptout`, and based on this, it will be determined
whether the `PushNotificationChannel` is allowed.

It should also be noted that django-push-notifications_ does not currently
implement sending notifications to IOS devices using the FCM channel,
although the FCM service itself supports it.
This means that support for IOS devices should be added on the edx-ace side.
At the moment, we didn't plan to add this directly to the
django-push-notifications_ package, but to limit it to an additional method
in `PushNotificationChannel` that implements the collection of the necessary
context for iOS devices to send notifications to them as well.

This will involve:
  - PushNotificationRenderer: Responsible for formatting and structuring the content
    of a push notification. This includes setting the notification's title, body,
    and optional data payload. The renderer will ensure that the notification content
    adheres to the specifications required by the firebase_admin_ SDK.
  - PushNotificationChannel: Handles sending formatted push notifications using
    the firebase_admin_ SDK. The channel will integrate with django-push-notifications_
    to streamline the process of dispatching notifications. The core edx-platform
    will handle authorization and manage Firebase credentials, ensuring secure and
    authenticated communication with the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service.
    Also, context collection for IOS devices using APNSConfig will be added to the channel
    for correct notification rendering.

To configure push notification from platform side, you will need to add/update the following settings in edx-platform:
  - `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` — add the Firebase credentials for the FCM service;
  - `ACE_ENABLED_CHANNELS` — add the 'push_notification' channel to the list;
  - `ACE_ENABLED_POLICIES` — add policies for 'push_notification' to the list;
  - `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETTINGS` — settings required for the `django-push-notifications` module;
  - Add `push_notifications` to the INSTALLED_APPS.

To create a new push notification, on edx-platform side the following steps are required:
  - Create a new message type class that extends existing `BaseMessageType` from
    `openedx.core.djangoapps.ace_common.message`, defining the message type and its associated renderer.
    This will also allow you to use the existing classes like `EnrollEnrolled`, `AllowedEnroll`, etc.
    to send push notifications by simply extending the context where necessary and creating
    new templates with notification body.
  - Create new body.txt and subject.txt templates for the push notification content like how it is done for email.
    Example path: `lms/templates/instructor/edx_ace/enrollenrolled/push/body.txt`.
  - Collect the necessary context for the notifications.
  - Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) credentials and configure the edx-platform
    to communicate with the FCM service.
  - Add `PushNotificationChannel` to the enabled channels in the setting.
  - Call the `ace.send` method to send the push notification.

Consequences
------------

1. Adds a new push notification channel, enhancing the notification system's capabilities.
2. Allows real-time communication with users, improving engagement and user experience.
3. Seamless integration with existing edx-ace framework, maintaining consistency and reliability.
4. Utilizes django-push-notifications_ and firebase_admin_, leveraging robust
   and widely-used technologies for push notifications.
5. Additional complexity in the notification system, requiring maintenance and potential updates.
6. Dependency on Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service, which might introduce external service dependency risks.


It was decided not to expand the codebase unnecessarily and not to independently implement
models and views for storing user device tokens, mechanisms for sending push notifications,
or mechanisms for deactivating inactive tokens, as all of this functionality is already
available in the django-push-notifications_ package. Therefore, it is better for edx-ace to
use the existing `GCMDevice` model, and on the edx-platform side, add the `GCMDeviceViewSet`
view to allow mobile devices to send their tokens.
