edX Automated Communication Engine (A.C.E.)
===========================================
The automated communication engine, A.C.E. for short, is a Django app for messaging learners on the edX platform. This
app can be installed in any edX project, but has only been tested with ``edx-platform``. Email delivery (via Sailthru)
is the only current delivery channel. In the future we may add support for other delivery channels such as push
notifications.
